# Landing page template

This project is for The Odin Project.
I will comeback later to replace everything with an actual site. for now i will leave it this way and only practice html and css. I will update this readme as well so it will reflect future updates.

## Things i practiced during this asignment

- HTML markdown
- CSS styles
- Flexbox
- Css units (px, %, and vh)

## Things i don't understand completely

- adecuate font sizes for each heading and subsequent parragraph (typographic scale).
- adecuate margins between sections and it's contents.
- best practices when writing css.
